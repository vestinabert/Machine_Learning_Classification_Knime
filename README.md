This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to classify data using various algorithms and data preparation methods. The main steps of the project are as follows:

- **Dataset Selection**: A dataset was selected from a publicly available source (e.g., [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)).
- **Algorithm Selection**: Four classification algorithms were chosen and used to build machine learning models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Different data preparation techniques were tested, and their impact on the results was analyzed.
- **Parameter Optimization**: The models were experimentally evaluated with parameter optimization techniques to improve performance.
- **Implementation**: The project was implemented in KNIME, with all program steps properly named for clarity and reproducibility.
- **Results**: The final models and results were documented in a structured spreadsheet, with results evaluated and commented on.

All code or workflows are shared in this repository, along with the final analysis and insights derived from the experiments.
